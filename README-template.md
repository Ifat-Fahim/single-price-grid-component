## My process

### Built with

-   Semantic HTML5 markup
-   CSS custom properties
-   Flexbox

### What I learned

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```css
.card-bottom > * {
    flex: 1 1 50%;
}
```

### Continued development

I'll try to imporve the colors of the component. The color combination that I used is not perfect. I'll also try to fix the spacing problems.
